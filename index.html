                We are proud to introduce Team #34, a dynamic group of
                five Georgia Tech students collaborating on an exciting
                project as part of GT-2340. Our team consists of four
                Computer Science majors and one Computer Engineering major,
                bringing together a diverse range of skills in software
                development, system architecture, and problem-solving.

                Our websites are built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
                provide an interactive, user-friendly, and fast experience! We’ve
                integrated the OpenStreetMap API to offer a detailed and
                responsive map, highlighting popular restaurants and eateries
                in the vicinity of Georgia Tech’s Atlanta campus. Whether
                you’re a student looking for a quick bite or a visitor exploring
                the area, our map provides an easy way to discover dining options around the campus.

                    Hi! I'm Alex Jenkins,
                    a Computer Engineering major at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
                    You can check out <a target=blank href="https://alexj.io/">my website</a> to see my previous
                    projects and experiences. For the AFF project, I served as the full
                    stack developer and Scrum master. My role involved quickly setting
                    up the application's framework, allowing the rest of the
                    team to build out the necessary features. I also worked on resolving 
                    merge conflicts, bug fixes, and addressing communication challenges between team members.
