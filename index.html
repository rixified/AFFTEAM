                We're Team #34, a dynamic group of
                five Georgia Tech students collaborating on an exciting
                first project as part of GT-2340. Our team consists of four
                Computer Science majors and one Computer Engineering major,
                bringing together a diverse range of skills in software
                development, system architecture, and problem-solving.

                Our websites are built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
                provide an interactive, user-friendly, and fast experience! We’ve
                integrated the OpenStreetMap API to offer a detailed and
                responsive map, highlighting popular restaurants and eateries
                in the vicinity of Georgia Tech’s Atlanta campus. We also used
                Figma to design a basic website, and Trello+Teams for asynchronous communication and collaboration.

                Whether you’re a student looking for a quick bite or a visitor exploring
                the area, our map provides an easy way to discover dining options around the campus!
